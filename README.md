#### Description:
ratemyuni is a website that takes in reviews from real students about their universities for my country in Malaysia. One of the hardest decisions I had to made was deciding which 
univeristy to attend after my A-level Exams thus I search everywhere on the internet to find reviews of universities but was either disappointed by only the 2 reviews displayed or 
couldn't find any information at all. In the end I had to ask my local subreddit for their opinions on the university they attended, therefore, I'd liked to make a web app to take in 
anonymous reviews from students to allow a platform for young teenagers just like me to see which university best aligned with their needs and expectations.

This web application is in many ways similar to a known website called ratemyprofessors.com and indeed its where my inspiration came from as that website provided a much needed
solution for students in America and this was my solution for students in my home country, Malaysia.

First, I started with the implimentation of a login and register route for students to save their preferences of what universities they attended and even included Email checker API 
but decided to leave that out in my final web application as it did not provide much benefit and thought that it won't sound like reviews would be anonymous as their accounts would 
be connected to their reviews.
